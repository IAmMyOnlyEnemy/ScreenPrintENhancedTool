# ScreenPrintENhancedTool
This is a Python program done in order to help me with the daily work and to make the routine of completing a test book more enjoyable.

This are the requirements it needs to achive:
  - Make a print screen of a given area of the screen and save it as an image file on the disc
  - Allow easy access to at least 2 dimensions of the frame
  - Keep a simple, but consistent naming metodology. This should reflect the test book structure: 01 Test Situation 1 / A Test case a / Test case a proof_01 / Test case a proof_02
    According to this format "nA_name_m", where:
    * n -> number from 1 to 25, displayed always with 2 digits (ex: 3 -> 03)
    * A -> an upper case letter from A to Z
    * name -> name of the content of the print screen
    * m -> number from 1 to 25, displayed always with 2 digits (ex: 3 -> 03)
  - Allow image files to be overridden, but give a visual hint
  - Allow automatic change of image name so will not be overridden
  - Allow easy access to settings, that are kept even after the application was closed
  - Allow chain print according to input details
