# ScreenPrintENhancedTool
This is a Python program done in order to help me with the daily work and to make the routine of completing a test book more enjoyable. It was pure fun to code it and learn Python along the way.

## How to run the app
Download it from /output folder. In order to function proper, it also requires the /Images folder

## How to use the app
Click on buttons and see what happens. Also play with settings from setting.txt file. It's self explanatory for the most part. For details check the wiki of this project.

## My requirements of the app
  - Make a print screen of a given area of the screen and save it as an image file on the disc
  - Allow easy access to at least 2 dimensions of the frame
  - Keep a simple, but consistent naming metodology. This should reflect the test book structure: 01 Test Situation 1 / A Test case a / Test case a proof_01 / Test case a proof_02
    According to this format "nA_name_m", where:
    * n -> number from 1 to 25, displayed always with 2 digits (ex: 3 -> 03)
    * A -> an upper case letter from A to Z
    * name -> name of the content of the print screen
    * m -> number from 1 to 25, displayed always with 2 digits (ex: 3 -> 03)
  - Allow image files to be overridden, but give a visual hint
  - Allow automatic change of image name so will not be overridden
  - Allow easy access to settings, that are kept even after the application was closed
  - Allow chain print according to input details
